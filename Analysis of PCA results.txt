########  Analysis of PCA results
When four stocks come from one sector, the biggest eigenvalue is 1.00343384e-03, 
the proportion of variation accounted for by which is 77.85%. When it comes to four stocks
from different sectors, the biggest eigenvalue is 0.00095088, the proportion of 
variation accounted for by which is 59.97%. As we can see, 59.97%<77.85%.
The difference is mainly because stocks from the same sector have larger correlations than stocks from different sectors.
